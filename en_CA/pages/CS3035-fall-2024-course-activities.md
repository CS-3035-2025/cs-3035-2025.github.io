## Course Work Details

Below is an overview of the coursework.  

### Course Work and Marking Scheme (Tentative)

The grading scheme and number of items in the grade (in parentheses) are tentative and subject to reasonable adjustments. Please take a look at the syllabus for details on missed or late work for assessment.

- Individual Projects (2 projects): 40%
- Group Video Presentation of Alternative UI Technology (1): 10% 
- Quizzes (in-lab) (10 quizzes): 20% 
- Activities (10 activities): 30%

### Projects

Projects are larger and more challenging development tasks that aim to reinforce the theoretical topics in the course and give you hands-on practical experience in developing graphical user interfaces. 

Projects should be completed using the course software (TypeScript/SimpleKit, VSCode, Git); see [Working with Git for Assignment and Examples] for more details.

### Group Video Presentation

The group video presentation will require you to independently research and learn the basics of an alternative UI technology for another language (other than TypeScript/SimpleKit or Java). You will work with a group to create a short video presentation introducing the technology, its philosophy, and its basic use. You will also individually watch videos from other students in the class and prepare a short submission outlining what you have learned. A few videos may be selected for class review. 

### Quizzes

Quizzes will combine multiple-choice, short-answer questions, and other similar short questions touching on content from previous lectures.  You will complete them during class time on Thursdays. The tests will cover any content covered in class or that has been assigned (e.g., online readings). They will be completed via D2L.

You must be in class to complete the quiz. Quizzes will start right at 10:00am and you will have a limited time to complete them, so arriving on time is very important.

### Activities

Activities are coding assignments that are completed in two parts. 

**Part 1** should be completed in class on Thursdays and verified by your instructor before you leave class. 
**Part 2** should be completed by the end of Monday and submitted to Github.

## Important Dates and Deliverable Deliverables

**NOTE: All dates are tentative and are used as general targets.** Date adjustments will be made as needed, giving you additional time to avoid major conflicts. Adjustments to these dates will be announced in lectures.
