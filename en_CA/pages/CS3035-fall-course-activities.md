## Course Work Details

Below is an overview of the coursework.  

### Course Work and Marking Scheme (Tentative)

The grading scheme and number of items in the grade (in parentheses) are tentative and subject to reasonable adjustments. Please take a look at the syllabus for details on missed or late work for assessment.

- Individual Projects (2 projects): 30%
- Group Video Presentation of Alternative UI Technology (1): 10% 
- Quizzes (in-class) (8 quizzes): 20% 
- Activities (5 activities): 20%
- Final Exam: 20%

### Projects

Projects are larger and more challenging development tasks that aim to reinforce the theoretical topics in the course and give you hands-on practical experience in developing graphical user interfaces. 

Projects should be completed using the course software (TypeScript/SimpleKit, VSCode, Git); see [Working with Git for Assignment and Examples] for more details.

### Group Video Presentation

The group video presentation will require you to independently research and learn the basics of an alternative UI technology for another language (other than TypeScript/SimpleKit or Java). You will work with a group to create a short video presentation introducing the technology, its philosophy, and its basic use. Your videos will be watched in class and your group is expected to be in attendance to answer questions about the technology you chose. Quizzes will include details from the group presentations.

### Quizzes

Quizzes will combine multiple-choice, short-answer questions, and other similar short questions touching on content from previous lectures.  You will complete them during class time on Thursdays. The tests will cover any content covered in class or that has been assigned (e.g., online readings). They will be completed via D2L.

You must be in class to complete the quiz. Quizzes will start right at 10:00am and you will have a limited time to complete them, so arriving on time is very important.

### Activities

Activities are coding assignments that are completed independently by each student and submitted on GitHub. 

### Final Exam

The final exam will take place during the university's exam period and will be scheduled by the Registrarâ€™s Office. The final exam is cumulative and will cover material from the entire term, and could include multiple choice, T/F, matching, and written questions. Further details will be provided closer to the exam period. 

## Important Dates and Deliverable Deliverables
